# GPSC Pricing Data

This project aims to make data supplied by the [Georgia Public Service Commission](https://psc.ga.gov/) more accessible for data scientists and end users:

* Regularly archives the latest available GPSC Gas Marketer Price Chart PDFs from the [Gas Marketers Pricing Comparison](https://psc.ga.gov/utilities/natural-gas/marketers-pricing-index/).
    * See [`data/charts`](./data/charts) for archived PDFs.
* (Coming soon, work in progress): Processes the PDFs into machine-readable CSV files for easier analysis.

Note: This project is neither operated by nor endorsed by the GPSC.
